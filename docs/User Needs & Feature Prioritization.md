# **Defining User Needs & Feature Prioritization**

---

## **Step 1: Identify User Needs**

1. Users prioritize ease of use through social media to communicate about events.  
2. Users need better advertisement (currently a large barrier to finding out about upcoming events).  
3. Many users seek direct invitation to events.  
4. Need a unified system for discovering social events (currently scattered across many platforms).  
5. Users need to know who is attending a given event before choosing to go.

## **Step 2: Feature Prioritization Using MoSCoW**

| Feature | Category (M/S/C/W) | Justification |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Login with a verified student ID | Must-have | Ensures use by highschool students |
| Search / sort feature | Should-have | It helps users acquire more information quicker but is not required for launch. (Sorts events by type) |
| Push notifications | Could-have | Useful for user engagement and reminders but not required |
| Transportation offers | Won’t-have | Too complex and possibly dangerous  |

## **Step 3: Mapping the Basic User Journey**

1. **Define the User Persona**:

2. **Outline the Key Steps**:  
   * Awareness (How does the user find out about the app?)  
- Social media promotions (on most commonly used apps of Instagram and Snapchat), word of mouth (tell friends), and flyers (use red bulletins)  
  * Access & Onboarding (How do they sign up and log in?)  
- They go on the website and sign up with student id and email associated with a school.   
  * Core Action (What is the main thing the user will do in the app?)  
- Find/search or post an upcoming social event.  
  * Task Completion (What confirms they’ve achieved their goal?)  
- When a user attends an event or is able to host an event through the app.  
  * Return & Engagement (What brings them back to the app?)  
- Ease of communication and broadening of opportunities.   
3. **Map It Out**
